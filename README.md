# fsm_kernels
## Description
FSM kernels are FSM modules which FPGA designer can use as building blocks to create complex control circuits. In practice, the use of such FSM cores speeds up the development process. Several FSM kernels can be connected in hierarchical manner such that one FSM kernel "call" other FSM kernels as procedures. Also it is convenient to implement cellular automata with different rules by using FSM kernels
